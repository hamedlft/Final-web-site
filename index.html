                        <p>The fourth industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0, is driven by data and machine learning.</p>
                        <p>The Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, AI, Autonomous Robots, and Simulation/Digital Twins are among the cutting-edge technology that companies are integrating into their industrial processes.</p>
                        <p>In This work, development of an example of Industry 4.0  applications that collabrating each other to control, monitor, store process output data of an airheater device will be presented.
                            Air Heater control application and database applications are developed in LabVIEW and data monitoring application is developed by ASP.NET Core.  The data monitoring application is developed on Microsoft Azure cloud service.</p>

                        <p>Figure 1 shows system sketch of the process with data flow direction. Air heater control application publish its data to a MQTT broker application and then air heater database application subscribes to the broker and store receiving data in a SQL database.
                            Finally aire heater data monitoring web application visulize the sotred data in the SQL database in chart and figure. The application is developed on Microsodt Azure, however it is also possible to use it locally with a local SQL database.

                        <li>Development of Air Heater Control Application</li>
                        <p>The air heater control application is developed in LabVIEW. It reads outlet temperature of air heater mathematical model or actual device and it is filter by a low pass filter function. then it goes to a discrete PI controller to keep the temperature to a setpoint.
                            The temperature data is published to another LabVIEW application  which is a MQTT Broker application using MQTT protocol. An MQTT publisher code can be seen below first LabVIEW while loop box.
                            Figure 2 shows screenshot of the air heater control application LabVIEW code. The application has PI controller setting menu that user can
                            can tune the system and also see control signal and process output (temperature) together.
                        </p>

                         <h2 class="section-heading">Discussion and Conclusion</h2>
                         <p>The mentioned applications successfully were created and tested. The data monitoring web application is deployed on Microsoft Azure. 
                            MQTT was used  to published Air Heater outlet temperature.                            
                            MQTT Broker and Publisher code could be more secure by adding authentication and input data validation. 
                            </p>Regarding cyber security, typical examples of SQL injection includes:
                            <ul><li>Retrieving hidden data, where in scenario you can change a SQL query to get more information.</li> 
                                <li>Modifying a query to interact with the logic of the application, which is exploiting application logic. Data can be retrieved from different database tables.</li></ul>
                                                    
                              <p>These could be prevented by input validation and parametrized queries inside application.</p>
                         
                             In terms of MQTT Security Issues:
                             <ul>
                                                        <li>Maybe a user can Subscribe to published data on Broker without athutentican.</li>
                                                        <li>Also a user may published SQL injection queries by sending malicious topic and message to the broker.</li>
                                                    </ul>
                                                  Some solution are suggested as follows:
                                                        <li>Add User and Password to the Broker.</li> 
                                                        <li>Active SSL/TSL connection for the Broker.</li>
                                                        <li>The database moitoring application strickly looks for float value as temperature data, thus sending SQL injection queries cannot destroy or give access to un authorized user.</li>
                                                 </ul>
